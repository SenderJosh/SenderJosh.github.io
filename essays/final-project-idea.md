# Project: RateMyMajor

## Overview

<i>The Problem</i>: Many UH students may have a problem with figuring out which classes to take for their major that could easily drive them to their goal of graduation. Many students would like to hear the experience that other students had from taking a professor's class to help them decide whether or not another professor would suit them better.

<i>The solution</i>: RateMyMajor will allow students to anonymously recommend and review classes from their major. First, they select what their major is and then it lists all the professors and the classes they teach for that major.

Students will then be able to publish their review/recommendation for that course and professor, and tell the other students how he or she felt about it.

## Mockup page ideas

- Landing page
- UH login page
- Class/Professor Directory
- Class/Professor Recommendation/Review page
- Admin page

## Use case ideas

1. New user goes onto the landing page
2. Logs into their UH account
3. Gets redirected to the class/professor directory page, and chooses the class or professor they want to review or recommend or read the reviews of them
4. Writes and publishes a review or just reads the past reviews to get an overall feel of whether or not they want to take that class, or another class

## Beyond the basics

- Ability to report bad/troll reviews
- Star rating system (that also shows the average rating at the top)
