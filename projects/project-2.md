This project started off as a way to just get myself familiar with XML and design. I also wanted to manage a Facebook page at the time, but because I knew I'd become busy with school and other activities, I knew that I wouldn't be able to compete with the larger pages out there. 

I knew already that Facebook had a way to schedule posts, but the process was just a killer. You could only schedule one post at a time, and you had to do it manually. The steps were as follows: Upload the image/video and/or write a message to go along with it, click a drop menu to get the option to schedule your post, select the date and time, then click "schedule." Many pages post a few things every few hours or so, if not a cluster at a certain time. So to compete, in addition to having to find/make content for the page, I would also have to spend a lot of time scheduling the posts which would eat up whatever spare time I had.

So out of laziness, I started this project. Which is ironic; I put in more work and research into something so that I could be lazy. And so I found the framework (which is outdated, near zero documentation, and had to learn how to use it by guessing the equivalent process with Facebook's official not-C# API), started working on my project, and just dove in and went from there.

After a few (thousand) head scratches, I finally came out with the finished product and started working on documenting and putting it on github since by the time I finished, I had completely lost motivation to make and manage the Facebook page.
