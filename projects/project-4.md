The parking situtation at the University of Hawaii at Manoa is not the best, and because of this, the University issues carpooling permits to students who apply, as well as standard permits. Carpooling permits are similar to the standard permits, but implies that they are going to be carpooling another student with them to save parking space. Not many students know about that permit, and even then it is difficult to find someone who is willing and nearby to work with your schedule.

UHPool is a carpooling app made using Meteor. The app is connected to the University of Hawaii CAS so only University of Hawaii students may use this app, and is linked to their UH accounts. With this app, students can connect to each other and carpool with each other to save gas and help remedy the busy-parking situation at UH Manoa, and other UH colleges.
