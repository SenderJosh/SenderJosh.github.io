Koala Space Program was a hackathon project that I did with a few of my friends, Stephani Diep, Ryan Tanaka, and Aditya Kumar. The idea was to simulate what life would be like on Mars, should we ever build a colony up there. However we also saw a funny video of Koalas fighting so at the heat of the moment, we decided to make it <i>koala themed</i>.

We never expected our project to take off, partially because during the entire development of the game, we were having such a blast making jokes like "we are going to <i>koala-nize</i> Mars!" After we heard we were nominees and then top 25 semi-finalists for the people's choice competition, we decided to start our tea campaign, which [got featured on Hawaii News Now](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/31941921/koalas-in-space-uh-students-whimsical-mars-simulation-game-tackles-real-problems), at school for some <i>koala-tea</i> iced tea to fetch some votes.

After some time we learned that we finished at #7 internationally. Even though we couldn't make it to the finals, I'm still surprised that this game we scrapped together made it this far and was able to achieve as much as we got to.
